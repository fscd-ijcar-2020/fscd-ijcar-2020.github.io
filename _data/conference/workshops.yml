      This workshop aims at bringing together researchers who are currently
      developing theory and applications of linear calculi or use linear
      logic as a technical tool or a methodological guidline, to foster
      their interaction and provide a forum for presenting new ideas and
      work in progress, and enable newcomers to learn about current
      activities in this area. Linearity is a key feature in both
      theoretical and practical approaches to computer science, and the goal
      of this workshop is to present work exploring linearity both in theory
      and practice. The addressed topics include proof representation,
      operational, static and dynamical models of programming languages,
      linear languages and type systems, parallelism and concurrency,
      quantum and probabilist computation, as well as philosophy and
      linguistics.

      Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
      representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of
      deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
      design and implementation on the one hand and their use in reasoning
      tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of
      formal computational systems on the other hand have been the focus
      of considerable research over the last three decades. This workshop
      will bring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to
      discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of
      logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding,
      inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques, and the expressivity
      and lucidity of the reasoning process.

      The 34th International Workshop on Unification is the next event in a
      series of international meetings devoted to unification theory and its
      applications. Unification is concerned with the problem of making two
      terms equal, finding solutions for equations, or making formulas
      equivalent. It is a fundamental process used in a number of fields of
      computer science, including automated reasoning, term rewriting, logic
      programming, natural language processing, program analysis, types, etc.

      Topics of interest of the workshop include syntactic and equational
      unification algorithms, matching and constraint solving, unification
      in modal, temporal, and description logics, higher-order unification,
      narrowing, disunification, anti-unification, complexity issues,
      combination methods, implementation techniques, and applications.

      This workshop brings together researchers theorem proving enthusiasts
      to discuss and compete in “proving contests”. While programming contests
      (e.g. ACM ICPC, International Olympiad in Informatics) challenge large
      numbers of participants to solve algorithmic problems within a short
      time, we envision proving contests to entice proof engineers
      to formally prove small but interesting problems from mathematics or
      computer science.
      An existing contest system (https://competition.isabelle.systems/)
      has been used to organize online proving contests where participants
      can solve tasks using Coq, Lean, or Isabelle.
      The workshop will be organized around an on-site contest,
      supplemented with informal discussions.
      We welcome participation from users of proof assistants which are not
      supported by the system.

      The two communities share many central interests, but researchers
      from these two communities rarely interact. Also, the lack of common
      or compatible interfaces of tools is an obstacle to their fruitful
      combination.
      Bridges between the communities in the form of common platforms and

      direct their interaction.
      The aim of the SC2 workshop is to provide fertile ground to discuss,

      with the overall aim to attract and help them to establish themselves
      as researchers in automated reasoning. The workshop will address
      challenges of the academic life and give insight in industrial research.
      For doing so, the workshop will include talks from leading experts of
      automated reasoning in academia and industry, and will also include
      presentations on career-planning.

      The workshop aims to reach and attract master students, PhD students
      and young postdocs as participants.

      The workshop aims at discussing recent developments in implementing,
      applying benchmarking and comparing first-order theorem provers and
      their combinations with other systems.
      The workshop is going to shed the light on problems such as
      - what is essential for substantial progress in theorem proving tools;
      - what are the best implementation principles to be used;
      - what are the best heuristics and strategies, depending on application areas; - both successful and unsuccessful case studies;
      - missing features in modern theorem provers.
      The workshop will also overview the most recent advances made in Vampire.

      Zipperposition is a highly modular first- and higher-order
      superposition-based theorem prover written in OCaml. In this tutorial, you
      will learn of its main modules, how to hack them and how to create new ones.
      Our aim is that after this tutorial, you can easily prototype your own
      calculi in Zipperposition.

      The tutorial will consist in three parts:

      1. an introduction to OCaml and Zip<perposition;
      2. implementing a resolution-based theorem prover using Zipperposition’s
        core libraries;
      3. and, implementing a theory module in Zipperposition.

      All parts will be hands-on sessions.
