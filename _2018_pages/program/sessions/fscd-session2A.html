        ABSTRACT. Uniqueness of normal forms w.r.t. conversion (UNC) of term rewriting systems (TRSs) guarantees that there are no distinct convertible normal forms. It was recently shown that the UNC property of TRSs is decidable for shallow TRSs (Radcliffe et al., 2017). The existing procedure mainly consists of testing whether there exists a counterexample in a finite set of candidates; however, the procedure suffers a bottleneck of having a sheer number of such candidates. In this paper, we propose a new procedure which consists of checking a smaller number of such candidates and enumerating such candidates more efficiently. Correctness of the proposed procedure is proved and its complexity is analyzed. Furthermore, these two procedures have been implemented and it is experimentally confirmed that the proposed procedure runs much faster than the existing procedure.

        ABSTRACT. Language-integrated query is a popular and powerful programming construct, which allows database queries and ordinary program code to interoperate seamlessly and safely. Language-integrated query techniques rely on classical results about monadic comprehension calculi, including the conservativity theorem for nested relational calculus. Conservativity implies that query expressions can freely use nesting and unnesting, yet as long as the query result type is a flat relation, these capabilities do not lead to an increase in expressiveness over flat relational queries. Moreover, Wong showed how such queries can be translated to SQL via a constructive rewriting algorithm, and subsequently Cooper and others advocated higher-order nested relational calculi as a basis for language-integrated queries in languages such as Links and F#. However, as we explain, there is no published proof of the central strong normalization property for higher-order nested relational queries: a previous proof attempt does not deal correctly with rewrite rules that duplicate subterms. This paper fills the gap in the literature, explaining the difficulty with a previous proof attempt, and showing how to extend the TT-lifting approach of Lindley and Stark to accommodate duplicating rewrites.

        ABSTRACT. Wanda is a fully automatic termination analysis tool for higher-order term rewriting. In this paper, we will discuss the methodology used in Wanda. Most pertinently, this includes a higher-order dependency pair framework and a variation of the higher-order recursive path ordering, as well as some non-termination analysis techniques and delegation to a first-order tool. Additionally, we will discuss how to use Wanda in practice for systems in two different formalisms and present experimental results
