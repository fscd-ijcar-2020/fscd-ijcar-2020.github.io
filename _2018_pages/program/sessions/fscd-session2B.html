        ABSTRACT. We present a framework for symbolically executing and model checking higher-order programs with external (open) methods.
We focus on the client-library paradigm and in particular we aim to check libraries with respect to any definable client.
We combine traditional symbolic execution techniques with operational game semantics to build a symbolic execution semantics that captures arbitrary external behaviour.
We prove the symbolic semantics to be sound and complete.
This yields a bounded technique by imposing bounds on the depth of recursion and callbacks.
We provide an implementation of our technique in the K framework and showcase its performance on a custom benchmark based on higher-order coding errors such as reentrancy bugs.

        ABSTRACT. We introduce PHFL, a probabilistic extension of higher-order fixpoint logic.
PHFL may also be regarded as a higher-order extension of
probabilistic temporal logics such as PCTL and \(\mu^p\)-calculus.
We show that PHFL is strictly more expressive than \(\mu^p\)-calculus, and
that the PHFL model checking problem for finite Markov chains is
undecidable even for the \(\mu\)-only, order-\(1\) fragment of PHFL.
Furthermore, we show a translation from Lubarsky's MuArithmetic to
PHFL, which implies that PHFL model checking is \(\Pi^1_1\)-hard.
As a positive result, we characterize a decidable fragment of the PHFL
model checking problems using a novel type system.

        ABSTRACT. We extend the constructive differential game logic (\CdGL) of hybrid
games with a refinement connective that relates two hybrid games. We
use this connective to prove a folk theorem relating hybrid games to
hybrid systems.

        ABSTRACT. We study a mixture between the average case and worst case complexities of higher-order model checking, the problem of deciding whether the tree generated by a given λY-term (or equivalently, a higher-order recursion scheme) satisfies the property expressed by a given tree automaton.
Higher-order model checking has recently been studied extensively in the context of higher-order program verification.
Although the worst-case complexity of the problem is k-EXPTIME complete for order-k terms, various higher-order model checkers have been developed that run efficiently for typical inputs, and program verification tools have been constructed on top of them.
One may, therefore, hope that higher-order model checking can be solved efficiently in the average case, despite the worst-case complexity.
We provide a negative result, by showing that, under certain assumptions, for almost every term, the higher-order model checking problem specialized for the term is k-EXPTIME hard with respect to the size of automata.
The proof is based on a novel intersection type system that characterizes terms that do not contain any useless subterms.
