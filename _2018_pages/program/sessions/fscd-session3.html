        ABSTRACT. I have focused a lot of the applied side of my work over the last 20 years on formal veriﬁcation of arithmetic in some sense.  Originally my main focus was on veriﬁcation of ﬂoating-point algorithms for division, square root, transcendental functions etc. More recently my interests have shifted to discrete arithmetical primitives, large integer arithmetic, and elliptic curve operations. As well as many contrasts and special problems, there are a number of common themes running through all this work: the challenges of veriﬁcation at the unstructured machine- code level or indeed even getting adequate speciﬁcations for machine instruction sets, the countervailing beneﬁt of generally having clear and incontrovertible speciﬁcations of the functions themselves, and the value of special customized decision procedures in making veriﬁcations of this kind practical. I will give an overview of some of the highlights of this work, as well as talking in more detail about my current project.
