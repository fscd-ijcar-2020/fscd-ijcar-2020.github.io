        ABSTRACT. We consider three graphs, G_{7,3}, G_{7,4}, and G_{7,6}, related to Keller's conjecture in dimension 7. The conjecture is false for this dimension if and only if at least one of the graphs contains a clique of size 2^7 = 128. We present an automated method to solve this conjecture by encoding the existence of such a clique as a propositional formula. We apply satisfiability solving combined with symmetry-breaking techniques to determine that no such clique exists. This result implies that every unit cube tiling of R^7 contains a facesharing pair of cubes. Since a faceshare-free unit cube tiling of R^8$exists (which we also verify), this completely resolves Keller's conjecture.

        ABSTRACT. In this paper we show that the QBF proof checking format QRAT (Quantified Resolution Asymmetric Tautologies) by Heule, Biere and Seidl cannot have polynomial time strategy extraction unless P=PSPACE. In our proof, the crucial property that makes strategy extraction PSPACE-hard for this proof format is universal expansion, even expansion on a single variable.<br/>
While expansion reasoning used in other QBF calculi can admit polynomial time strategy extraction, we find this is conditional on a property studied in proof complexity theory. We show that strategy extraction on expansion based systems can only happen when the underlying propositional calculus has the property of feasible interpolation.

        ABSTRACT. Propositional proof systems based on recently-developed redundancy properties admit short refutations for many formulas traditionally considered hard. Redundancy properties are also used by procedures which simplify formulas in conjunctive normal form by removing redundant clauses. Revisiting the covered clause elimination procedure, we prove the correctness of an explicit algorithm for identifying covered clauses, as it has previously only been implicitly described. While other elimination procedures produce redundancy witnesses for compactly reconstructing solutions to the original formula, we prove that witnesses for covered clauses are hard to compute. Further, we show that not all covered clauses are propagation redundant, the most general, polynomially-verifiable standard redundancy property. Finally, we close a gap in the literature by demonstrating the complexity of clause redundancy itself.

<it>Solving bit-vectors with MCSAT: explanations from bits and pieces.</it>

        ABSTRACT. We develop a treatment of the theory of fixed-sized bit-vectors
in the MCSAT framework. MCSAT is an alternative to CDCL(T) for
SMT solving and can be seen as an extension of CDCL to other
domains than the Booleans.
To apply MCSAT to bit-vectors, we use Binary Decision Diagrams
to record and update the set of feasible values for a bit-vector
variable and we develop specialized conflict-explanation mechanisms.
We present two methods based on interpolation that generate word-level
explanations. These methods are applicable when the conflict is
restricted to two fragments of bit-vector arithmetic.  We use
aggressive normalization to shoehorn as many conflicts as
possible into these fragments. When that fails, we resort to
bit-blasting to generate explanations.
The approach is implemented in the Yices 2 SMT solver. We present
experimental results.
