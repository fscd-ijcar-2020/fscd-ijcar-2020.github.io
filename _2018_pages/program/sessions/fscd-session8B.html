        ABSTRACT. Concurrent Kleene Algebra is an elegant tool for equational reasoning about concurrent programs. An important feature of concurrent programs that is missing from CKA is the ability to restrict legal interleavings. To remedy this we extend the standard model of CKA, namely pomsets, with a new feature, called boxes, which can specify that part of the system is protect from outside interference. We study the algebraic properties of this new model. Another drawback of CKA is that the language used for expressing properties of programs is the same as that which is used to express programs themselves. This is often too restrictive for practical purposes. We provide a logic, `pomset logic', that is an assertion language for specifying such properties, and which is interpreted on pomsets with boxes. We develop the basic metatheory for the relationship between pomset logic and CKA, including frame rules to support local reasoning, and illustrate this relationship with simple examples.

        ABSTRACT. Reactive systems à la Leifer and Milner, an abstract categorical
framework for rewriting, provide a suitable framework for deriving
bisimulation congruences. This is done by synthesizing interactions
with the environment in order to obtain a compositional semantics.<br/>
We enrich the notion of reactive systems by conditions on two
levels: first, as in earlier work, we consider rules enriched with
application conditions and second, we investigate the notion of
conditional bisimilarity. Conditional bisimilarity allows us to say
that two system states are bisimilar provided that the environment
satisfies a given condition.<br/>
We present several equivalent definitions of conditional
bisimilarity, including one that is useful for concrete proofs and
that employs an up-to-context technique, and we compare with related
behavioural equivalences. We instantiate reactive systems in order
to obtain DPO graph rewriting and consider a case study in this
setting.

        ABSTRACT. Traditional session types prescribe bidirectional communication
protocols for concurrent computations, where well-typed programs are
guaranteed to adhere to the protocols. Recent work has extended
session types with refinements from linear arithmetic, capturing
intrinsic properties of processes and data. These refinements then
play a central role in describing sequential and parallel complexity
bounds on session-typed programs.<br/>
The Rast language and system provide an open-source implementation
of session-typed concurrent programs extended with arithmetic
refinements as well as ergometric and temporal types to capture work
and span of program execution. Type checking relies on Cooper's
algorithm for quantifier elimination in Presburger arithmetic with a
few significant optimizations, and a heuristic extension to
nonlinear constraints. Rast furthermore includes a reconstruction
engine so that most program constructs pertaining the layers of
refinements and resources are inserted automatically. We provide
a variety of examples to demonstrate the expressivity of the
language.
