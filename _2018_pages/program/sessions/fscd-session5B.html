        ABSTRACT. With hybrid systems becoming ever more pervasive, the underlying semantic challenges emerge in their entirety. The need for principled semantic foundations has been recognised previously in the case of discrete computation and discrete data, with subsequent implementations in programming languages and proof assistants. Hybrid systems, contrastingly, do not directly fit into the classical semantic paradigms due to the presence of quite specific “non-programmable” features, such as Zeno behaviour and the inherent indispensable reliance on an underlying notion of continuous time. Here, we analyse the phenomenon of hybrid semantics from a constructive viewpoint. In doing so, we propose a monad-based semantics, generic over a given ordered monoid, representing the time domain, hence abstracting over the monoid of constructive reals. We implement our construction as a higher inductive-inductive type in the recent cubical extension of Agda proof assistant, significantly using state-of-the-art advances of homotopy type theory. We show that classically, i.e. under the axiom of choice, the constructed monad admits an alternative charaterization in terms of directed chain completion.

        ABSTRACT. Optics are a data representation for compositional data access, with lenses as a popular special case. Hedges has presented a diagrammatic calculus for lenses, but in a way that does not generalize to other classes of optic. We present a calculus that works for all optics, not just lenses; this is done by embedding optics into their presheaf category, which naturally features string diagrams. We apply our calculus to the common case of lenses, and explore how the laws of optics manifest in this setting.

        ABSTRACT. In this paper, we study the bicategory of profunctors with the free finite coproduct pseudo-comonad and show that it constitutes a model of linear logic that generalizes the Scott model. We formalize the connection between the two models as a change of base for enriched categories which induces a pseudo-functor that preserves all the linear logic structure. We prove that morphisms in the co-Kleisli bicategory correspond to the concept of strongly finitary functors (sifted colimits preserving functors) between presheaf categories. We further show that this model provides solutions of recursive type equations which provides 2-dimensional models of the pure lambda calculus and we also exhibit a fixed point operator on terms which allows for the study of recursively defined terms.

        ABSTRACT. Lawvere observed in his celebrated work on hyperdoctrines that the set-theoretic schema of comprehension can be expressed in the language of categorical logic,
as a comprehension structure on the functor p: E->B defining the hyperdoctrine. In this paper, we formulate and study a strictly ordered hierarchy of three notions
of comprehension structure on a given functor p:E -> B,
which we call (i) comprehension structure, of (ii) comprehension structure with section, and of (iii) comprehension structure with image. Our approach is 2-categorical and we thus formulate the three levels of comprehension structure on a general morphism p:E -> B in a 2-category K. This conceptual point of view on comprehension structures enables us to revisit the works by Fumex, Ghani and Johann on the duality between comprehension structures and quotient structures on a given functor p:E -> B. In particular, we show how to lift the comprehension and quotient structures on a functor p: E -> B to the categories of algebras or coalgebras
associated to functors F_E: E -> B and F_B:B -> B of interest, in order to interpret reasoning by induction and coinduction in the traditional language of categorical logic, formulated in an appropriate 2-categorical way.
