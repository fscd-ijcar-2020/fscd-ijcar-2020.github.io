        ABSTRACT. Motivated by applications of first-order theorem proving to software analysis,
we introduce a new inference rule, called subsumption demodulation, to improve
support for reasoning with conditional equalities in superposition-based
theorem proving. We show that subsumption demodulation is a simplification
rule that does not require radical changes to the underlying superposition
calculus. We implemented subsumption demodulation in the theorem prover
Vampire, by extending Vampire with a new clause index and adapting its
multi-literal matching component. Our experiments, using the TPTP and SMT-LIB
repositories, show that subsumption demodulation in Vampire can solve many new
problems that could so far not be solved by state-of-the-art reasoners.

        ABSTRACT. We extend the graceful higher-order basic Knuth-Bendix order (KBO) of Blanchette et al. to an ordering that orients combinator equations left-to-right. The resultant ordering is highly suited to parameterising the first-order superposition calculus when dealing with the theory of higher-order logic, as it prevents inferences between the combinator axioms. We prove a number of desirable properties about the ordering including it having the subterm property for ground terms, being transitive and being well-founded. The ordering fails to be a reduction ordering as it lacks compatibility with certain contexts. We provide an intuition of why this need not be an obstacle when using it to parameterise superposition.

        ABSTRACT. We present a framework for formal refutational completeness proofs of abstract provers that implement saturation calculi, such as ordered resolution or superposition. The framework relies on modular extensions of lifted redundancy criteria. It permits us to extend redundancy criteria so that they cover subsumption, and also to model entire prover architectures in such a way that the static refutational completeness of a calculus immediately implies the dynamic refutational completeness of, e.g., an Otter or DISCOUNT loop prover implementing the calculus. Our framework is mechanized in Isabelle/HOL.

        ABSTRACT. We present a refutationally complete superposition calculus for a version of higher-order logic (HOL) based on the combinatory calculus. We also introduce a novel method of dealing with extensionality. The calculus was implemented in the Vampire theorem prover and we test its performance against other leading higher-order provers. The results suggests that the method is competitive.
