        ABSTRACT. The expressiveness of dependent type theory can be
extended by identifying types modulo some additional computation rules. But, for
preserving the decidability of type-checking or the logical
consistency of the system, one must make sure that those user-defined
rewriting rules preserve typing. In this paper, we give a new
method to check that property using Knuth-Bendix completion.

        ABSTRACT. We present in this paper an encoding in an extension with rewriting of the Edimburgh Logical
Framework (LF) [11] of two common features: universe polymorphism and eta-convertibility. This
encoding is at the root of the translator between Agda and Dedukti developped by the author.

        ABSTRACT. Dedukti is a type-checker for the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting, an extension of Edinburgh’s Logical
Framework (LF) where functions and type symbols can be defined by rewriting rules. It therefore
contains an engine for rewriting LF terms and types according to the rewriting rules given by
the user. A key component of this engine is the matching algorithm to find which rules can be
fired. In this paper, we describe the class of rewriting rules supported by Dedukti and the new
implementation of the matching algorithm. Dedukti supports non-linear rewriting rules on terms
with binders using higher-order pattern-matching as in Combinatory Reduction Systems (CRS).
The new matching algorithm extends the technique of decision trees introduced by Luc Maranget in
the OCaml compiler to this more general context.

        ABSTRACT. Indexed inductive types are a feature of most languages based on
dependent types. They are usually described either by syntactic
schemes or by encodings of strictly positive functors such as
combinator languages or containers. The former approaches are
informal and give only external signatures, the latter approaches
suffer from encoding overheads and do not directly represent mutual
types.<br/>
In this paper we propose a direct method for describing signatures
for mutual inductive families using a domain-specific type theory. A
signature is a context (roughly speaking, a list of types) in this
small type theory. Algebras, displayed algebras and sections are
defined by models of this type theory: the standard model, the
logical predicate and a logical relation interpretation,
respectively. We reduce the existence of initial algebras for these
signatures to the existence of the syntax of our domain-specific
type theory. As this theory is very simple, its normal syntax can be
encoded using W-types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first formalisation of the folklore fact that mutual inductive types
can be reduced to indexed W-types.<br/>
