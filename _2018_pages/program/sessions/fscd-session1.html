        ABSTRACT. Since the early days of the termination competition, there have always been wrong answers produced by termination analysis tools. One way to increase the reliability of the generated analyses is by certification, an approach where the answers of the termination tools are checked by some verified certifier.<br/>
This talk will cover an overview of the CeTA certifier, whose soundness has been proven in Isabelle/HOL. CeTA initially only supported termination proofs of term rewrite systems. The benefit was that no theory-reasoning was required, and therefore progress was made quickly. This situation dramatically changed when adding support for integer transition systems, i.e., a backend that is often used for termination analysis of imperative programs. Here, certification of termination proofs requires to prove the validity of quantifier-free formulas over the integers. After the development of such a verified reasoning engine, we also utilize it to further extend the support for term rewriting, where we recently added support for the weighted-path order with max-polynomial interpretations.
