        ABSTRACT. Algebraic datatypes, and among them lists and trees, have attracted a lot of interest in
automated reasoning and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).  Since its latest
stable version, the SMT-LIB standard defines a theory of algebraic datatypes,
which is currently supported by several mainstream SMT solvers.  
In this paper, we study this particular theory of datatypes and prove that it is strongly polite, 
showing also how it can be combined with other arbitrary disjoint theories using polite combination.  
Our results cover both inductive and finite datatypes, as well as their union.
The combination method uses a new, simple, and natural notion of additivity,
that enables deducing strong politeness from (weak) politeness.

        ABSTRACT. Uniform interpolants were largely studied in non-classical propositional logics since the nineties, and their connection to model completeness was pointed out in the literature. A successive parallel research line inside the automated reasoning community investigated uniform quantifier-free interpolants (sometimes referred to as “covers”) in first-order theories. In this paper, we investigate cover transfer to theory combinations in the disjoint signatures case. We prove that, for convex theories, cover algorithms can be transferred to theory combinations under the same hypothesis needed to transfer quantifier-free interpolation (i.e., the equality interpolating property, aka strong amalgamation property). The key feature of our algorithm relies on the extensive usage of the Beth definability property for primitive fragments to convert implicitly defined variables into their explicitly defining terms. In the non-convex case, we show by a counterexample that cover may not exist in the combined theories.

        ABSTRACT. This paper is concerned with logic-based modeling and automated
reasoning for estimating the current state of a system as it
evolves over time.  The main motivation is situational awareness,
which requires to being able to understand and explain a system's
current state, at any time, and at a level that matters to the
user, even if only partial or incorrect information about the
external events leading to that state is available.<br/>
The paper proposes to represent such states as models of a
logical specification of the properties of interest and a given a
set of external timestamped events up to ``now''.  The underlying 
modeling language is a grounded in logic programming, and models
are computed in a bottom-up way.  It adopts notions of
stratification, default negation and a possible model semantics
for its (disjunctive) program rules. In order to deal with
less-than-perfect event data, the modeling language features a
novel model revision operator that allows the programmer to
formulate conditions under which a model computation with a
corrected set of events should be attempted in an otherwise
inconsistent state.<br/>
Model computation and revision has a long history in the area of
logic programming. The novelty of our approach lies in the
specifics of the stratification employed, in terms of time and in
terms of whether a fact is an external event or derived, and in
the specifics of the model revision operator. Our approach
deliberately compromises on generality for the benefit of low
complexity and any-time reasoning capabilities as needed to
support situational awareness application well.<br/>
The paper provides the technical details of the approach. The
main theoretical results are soundness and completeness of the
proposed model computation algorithm.  On the applied side, the
paper describes an implementation as a shallow embedding into the
Scala programming language by means of the Scala macro
mechanism. This is important in practice, as it gives the
programmer built-in access to a full-fledged programming language
and its associated libraries.  The paper sketches the usefulness
of this feature and the model revision operator with a small
example for supply chain situational awareness.

        ABSTRACT. SGGS (Semantically-Guided Goal-Sensitive reasoning) is a conflict-driven first-order theorem-proving method which is refutationally complete and model complete in the limit. These features make it attractive as a basis for decision procedures. In this paper we show that SGGS decides the stratified fragment which generalizes EPR, the PVD fragment, and a new fragment that we dub restrained. The new class has the small model property, as the size of SGGS-generated models can be upper-bounded, and is also decided by hyperresolution and ordered resolution. We report on experiments with a termination tool implementing a restrainedness test, and with an SGGS prototype named Koala.
