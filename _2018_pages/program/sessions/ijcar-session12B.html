        ABSTRACT. The word problem for a finite set of ground identities is known to be decidable in polynomial time using congruence closure, and this is also the case if some of the function symbols are assumed to be commutative. We show that decidability in P is preserved if we add the assumption that certain function symbols f are extensional in the sense that f(s1,...,sn) = f(t1,...,t) implies s1 = t1,...,sn = tn. In addition, we investigate a variant of extensionality that is more appropriate for commutative function symbols, but which raises the complexity of the word problem to coNP.

        ABSTRACT. In text-encoding standards such as Unicode, text strings are sequences of
code points, each of which can be represented as a natural number. We
present a decision procedure for a (concatenation-free) theory of strings that
includes length and a conversion function from strings to integer code points.
Furthermore, we show that many common string operations, such as conversions
between lowercase and uppercase, can be naturally encoded using this conversion
function. We implement our approach in the SMT solver CVC4, which contains a
state-of-the-art string subsolver, and show that the use of a native procedure
for code points significantly improves its performance with respect to other
state-of-the-art string solvers.

        ABSTRACT. Given a Conditional Term Rewriting System (CTRS) R and terms s and t, the reachability condition s ->* t is called feasible if there is a substitution σ such that σ(s) ->*_R σ(t) holds; otherwise, it is infeasible. Checking infeasibility of (sequences of) reachability conditions is important in the analysis of computational properties of CTRSs like confluence or operational termination. In this paper, we generalize this notion of feasibility to enable the use of other relations (e.g., subterm |>, context-sensitive rewriting  \->, etc.) defined by first-order theories, so that more general properties can be investigated. We introduce a framework for proving feasibility/infeasibility, and a new tool, infChecker, which implements it.

        ABSTRACT. N-PAT is a new model-checking tool that supports the verification of nested-models -- i.e. models whose behavior depends on the results of verification tasks. In this paper, we describe its operation and discuss mechanisms that are tailored to the efficient verification of nested-models. Further, we motivate the advantages of N-PAT over traditional model-checking tools through a network security case study.
